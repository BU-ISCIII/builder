[![scif](https://img.shields.io/badge/filesystem-scientific-green.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://sci-f.github.io)

for a single reproducible container to have multiple entrypoints that can easily be
inspected, tested, and run. Read more about it in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/7/5/giy023/4931737" target="_blank">Gigascience</a> or the
